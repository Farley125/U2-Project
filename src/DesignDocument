LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
    private String original1
    private String original2
    private int x1
    private int x2
    private int y1
    private int y2
    private int distanceX
    private int distanceY
    private double slopeVal
    private String slopeStr
Constructor:
    LinearEquation(String input1, String input2)
    Will also calculate and store other values such as the two sets of x and y values, the distance between the sets of x and y values (x2-x1, y2,y1),
    the slope (as a string and double), and the original coordinates.

Methods:
    public String toString()
    - This will return the following information as a string:
    - The two original points
    - The equation of the line through the two points in y = mx + b format
    - The slope of the line (as a fraction) using distanceX() and distanceY()
    - The y-intercept of the line
    - The distance between the two points

    public double yIntercept()
    This will calculate the y-Intercept of the two given points using the slope and one of the given coordinates and return it as a double.
    y1-(slope*x1) = b

    public double distanceBetween()
    This will calculate the distanceBetween the two given points using pythagorean theorem, java.lang.Math.sqrt(distanceX^2 + distanceY^2) and return the value as a double.

    public double yCalc(int x)
    This will calculate the y value for a given x value.



EquationRunner class
    Step 1: Require the user to input the first coordinate
    Step 2: Require the user to input the second coordinate
    Step 3: Create an object using the LinearEquation(String input1, String input2) constructor with the two user inputs as parameters.
    Step 4: Call the new object into toString to convert data all data to strings.
    Step 5: Print the required information.
    Step 6: Require the user to input an x value.
    Step 7: Print the y value (calculated with yCalc()) and the inputted x value as a coordinate.
