LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
    private int x1
    private int x2
    private int y1
    private int y2
    private String slope
Constructor:
    LinearEquation(int x1,int x2,int y1,int y2)
    LinearEquation(int x1)

Methods:
    public String toString()
    - This will return the following information as a string:
    - The two original points
    - The equation of the line through the two points in y = mx + b format
    - The slope of the line (as a fraction) using distanceX() and distanceY()
    - The y-intercept of the line
    - The distance between the two points

    public String slope()
    This will return the slope as a fraction as a string.

    public int distanceX(int x1, int x2)
    This will return the difference of the two x values.

    public int distanceY(int y1, int y2)
    This will return the difference of the two y values.

    public double yIntercept()
    This will calculate the y-Intercept of the two given points using the slope and one of the given coordinates and return it as a double.
    y1-(slope*x1) = b

    public double distanceBetween()
    This will calculate the distanceBetween the two given points using pythagorean theorem. java.lang.Math.sqrt(distanceX^2 + distanceY^2) and return the value as a double.



EquationRunner class
    Step 1: Require the user to input the first coordinate
    Step 2: Require the user to input the second coordinate
    Step 3: Print the required information
    Step 4: Require the user to input an x value.
    Step 5: Print the y value and the inputted x value as a coordinate.


 This will calculate the slope of the given values. (x2 - x1)/(y2-y1) and return a .
